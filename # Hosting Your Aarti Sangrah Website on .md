# Hosting Your Aarti Sangrah Website on Google Drive

Follow these steps to host your website using Google Drive:

## 1. Organize Your Files

Make sure you have all these files ready:
- index.html
- styles.css
- script.js
- aartis.js
- (any image files if you added your own)

## 2. Upload Files to Google Drive

1. Go to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com) and sign in
2. Create a new folder called "Aarti-Website" (or any name you prefer)
3. Upload all your website files to this folder

## 3. Configure Sharing Settings

1. Right-click on your "Aarti-Website" folder
2. Select "Share"
3. Change the permissions to "Anyone with the link" or "Public on the web"
4. Click "Done"

## 4. Set Up for Web Hosting

Google Drive no longer supports direct HTML file hosting with proper rendering as it used to. Instead, we can use a service like DriveToWeb or GitHub Pages.

### Option A: Using DriveToWeb

1. Visit [DriveToWeb](https://drv.tw)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Select your "Aarti-Website" folder
4. Follow their instructions to publish your website
5. They will provide you with a URL to access your website

### Option B: Using GitHub Pages (Recommended)

1. Create a free GitHub account if you don't have one
2. Create a new repository
3. Upload all your website files to the repository
4. Go to the repository Settings > Pages
5. Set the source to "main" branch and Save
6. Your site will be published at a URL like `https://username.github.io/repository-name/`

## 5. Accessing Your Website

Once set up with one of the options above, you can share the provided URL with anyone to access your Aarti Sangrah website.

## Important Notes

- If you make updates to your files, you'll need to re-upload the changed files and possibly update the hosting
- Google Drive won't process server-side code (PHP, Node.js, etc.) as this is a static website
- Some advanced JavaScript features might be restricted depending on the hosting method

Enjoy your new Aarti Sangrah website!
